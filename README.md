### Project Description
[https://github.com/makerdao/community/issues/536](https://github.com/makerdao/community/issues/536)

### Development Setup
- Register on [https://theme-creator.discourse.org/](https://theme-creator.discourse.org/) and set import this repo as a theme
- Download the Discourse CLI as described in [this handy tutorial](https://meta.discourse.org/t/beginners-guide-to-using-theme-creator-and-theme-cli-to-start-building-a-discourse-theme/108444)
- Run the CLI from the root directory of this project
    - https://theme-creator.discourse.org/ is your base URL
    - The API key is generated inside of the theme-creator website; be sure to select "Individual User" because the "Everyone" key doesn't work and the CLI will quit silently.
- If everything is working correctly, the CLI says watching and the browser console will log messages.
